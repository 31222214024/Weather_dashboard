	Humidity levels



	Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)



	Weather icons that visually represent the conditions



•	Error Handling: Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or API errors.



•	Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard is mobile-friendly and works on various devices.





2.Proposed Solution



Technology Stack:



•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a framework like React.js for a more dynamic interface).



•	Backend: No backend is required for this simple application, as it will directly interact with the weather API from the frontend.



•	API: OpenWeather API (or a similar service) to fetch weather data.



Application Structure:



•	HTML: Create a simple structure with an input field for the city name, a button to submit the request, and a section to display the weather information.



•	CSS: Style the application to make it visually appealing and responsive. Use media queries to ensure it looks good on mobile devices.



•	JavaScript:



o	Handle user input and fetch data from the weather API.



o	Parse the API response and update the UI with the weather information.



o	Implement error handling to manage invalid city names or API errors.



User Flow:



	The user opens the weather dashboard.



	The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the “Get Weather” button.



	The application sends a request to the weather API with the city name.



	The application receives the weather data and displays:



o	Current temperature



o	Humidity percentage



o	Weather description



o	Appropriate weather icon



	If the city name is invalid or an error occurs, the application displays a user-friendly error message.



Deployment:



•	Host the application on a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for easy access.



•	Ensure the application is accessible via a public URL.



Documentation:



•	Create a README file in the GitHub repository that includes:

4.Architecture and workflow 



The architecture of the weather dashboard can be broken down into the following components:



Client-Side (Frontend):



•	User Interface (UI): Composed of input fields, buttons, and display areas for weather information.



•	JavaScript Logic: Handles user interactions, API requests, and updates the UI based on the API response.



API Integration:



•	Weather API: The application communicates with the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data based on user input (city name).



•	Data Flow: The application fetches data from the API and processes it to display relevant weather information to the user.



Workflow



The workflow of the weather dashboard can be outlined in the following steps:



User Interaction:



•	The user opens the weather dashboard in their web browser.



•	The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the “Get Weather” button.



API Request:



•	The JavaScript code captures the user input and constructs a request URL for the OpenWeather API, including the city name and the API key.



•	The application sends an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the OpenWeather API.



API Response:



•	The OpenWeather API processes the request and returns a JSON response containing the weather data for the specified city.



•	The response include information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather.



Data Processing:



•	The JavaScript code processes the JSON response, extracting the relevant data (temperature, humidity, weather description, and icon).



•	If the API returns an error (e.g., city not found), the application handles the error gracefully and displays an appropriate message to the user.



UI Update:



•	The application updates the UI with the fetched weather data, displaying the temperature, humidity, weather description, and the corresponding weather icon.



•	If there was an error, the application displays an error message instead.



User Experience:



•	The user can enter a new city name and repeat the process, allowing for quick checks of different locations.

5.Feasibility and Challenges



Feasibility:

 The development of a weather dashboard is feasible given the availability of modern web technologies and APIs. The OpenWeather API provides a straightforward way to access real-time weather data, and the tools required for development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React) are widely used and well-documented. Additionally, hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel make deployment easy and accessible.



Challenges:

•	API Rate Limits: Most free-tier APIs, including OpenWeather, have rate limits on the number of requests that can be made in a given time frame. This could affect the application’s performance if many users access it simultaneously.



•	Error Handling: Properly handling errors (e.g., invalid city names, network issues) and providing user-friendly feedback can be challenging. Ensuring that the application gracefully handles these scenarios is crucial for user experience.



•	Responsive Design: Creating a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices can be complex, especially if the application needs to accommodate various screen sizes and orientations.



•	Data Accuracy: The accuracy of the weather data depends on the API’s reliability. Users may receive outdated or incorrect information if the API experiences issues.
